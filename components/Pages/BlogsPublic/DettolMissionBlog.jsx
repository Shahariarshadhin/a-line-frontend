          In Bangladesh, maternal and child health remains a pressing challenge —
          particularly in underprivileged communities where access to healthcare
          and hygiene education is scarce. According to the World Bank, 30.8 out of every 1,000 children die due to complications often linked to poor hygiene practices among mothers.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Dettol, a brand synonymous with protection and hygiene, saw a powerful opportunity to step in and create real, lasting change — not just through products, but through purpose.
        </p>
  
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">
          The Objective: Protect Mothers to Protect the Future
        </h3>
        <p>
          The campaign titled &quot;Shurokkhito Maa, Shurokkhito Agami&quot;(Safe Mother,
          Safe Future) was designed with a clear and meaningful mission:
        </p>
        <p>
          To educate underprivileged pregnant women across Bangladesh about the importance of personal hygiene — and give them the tools to start building healthy habits, one small step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dettol understood that in order to impact future generations, mothers must be protected first — physically, emotionally, and hygienically.
        </p>
  
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">
          The Idea: One Bar of Soap Can Spark a Lifetime of Healthy Habits
        </h3>
        <p>
          At the heart of the campaign was a simple but powerful gesture: providing Dettol soap to expectant mothers in rural and underserved communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it wasn&apos;t just about product distribution. It was about education, empowerment, and collective action. The campaign invited consumers across the country to take part in the cause, making each purchase a contribution toward a safer tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900">
          The core message was clear: &quot;A healthy mother means a healthier future for the child — and for society.&quot;
        </p>
  
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black mt-8 mb-4">
          The Execution: From Awareness to Action
        </h3>
        <p>
          To drive awareness and build emotional resonance, we created a touching video commercial that highlighted the harsh realities faced by many underprivileged mothers — and how a small act of care can lead to life-changing outcomes.

          On-Ground Activation with BRAC
        </h4>
        <p>
          After the awareness phase, the campaign moved into its most impactful stage — direct outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
          In collaboration with BRAC, one of the world&apos;s largest development organisations, Dettol teams visited rural areas across Bangladesh:
