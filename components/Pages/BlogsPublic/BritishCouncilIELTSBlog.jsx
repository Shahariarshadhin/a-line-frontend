        In the high-stakes world of standardised testing, timing and user
        experience can make or break a conversion. For prospective IELTS
        candidates in Bangladesh, the British Council website offered a reliable
        test booking experience — but with a critical flaw. Test dates were only
        shown at the fourth step of the booking journey, significantly delaying
        visibility and planning for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This not only affected the user experience, but also led to inefficient
        ad spending — sending traffic to a journey that didn`&apos;t deliver value
        upfront. We saw an opportunity to make the system smarter, leaner, and
        far more performance-driven.

        The Objective: Make Test Dates Visible, and Make Every Impression Count
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our key goal was to shorten the journey between ad exposure and action.
        Instead of relying on a delayed reveal of test dates, we aimed to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Promote available IELTS test dates upfront in ads to improve planning
          and booking readiness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Automate updates in real-time, eliminating the need for constant
          manual intervention.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce irrelevant traffic and cut media wastage.</li>
        <li>
          Drive higher-quality clicks that convert into confirmed test bookings.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The Strategic Insight: Think Like an eCommerce Brand
      </h3>
      <p>
        Rather than solving this through traditional campaign tweaks, we decided
        to change the entire creative and delivery approach. Static ads were out
        of the question — they would`&apos;ve required frequent manual updates,
        resubmissions, and delayed approval times, which is unsustainable for
        time-sensitive information like test dates.
      </p>
      <p>Instead, we borrowed from eCommerce strategy.</p>

        What if IELTS test dates were treated like products?

        Results & Impact: Measurable Wins Across the Funnel
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Real-time automation reduced the need for ongoing manual ad updates by
          100%
        </li>
        <li>
          Higher quality traffic, with users more likely to convert since they
          saw test dates before clicking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Better media efficiency, as irrelevant traffic dropped significantly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most impressively, the campaign`&apos;s success led to the adoption of this
          strategy by the British Council India team.
